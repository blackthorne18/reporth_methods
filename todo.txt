For Step 3:
    Graph 4:
        (x axis) Plot graph  : for each genome pair
        (y axis) showing     : number of best hits from flanking sequences of one genome that are not reciprocated in the other genome
        Example              : With genome X on the x-axis and genome Y on the y-axis, how many times a flanking sequence from
                               X has a best hit in Y but is not reciprocated
        Note                 : Have this as a heatmap?
        Data Needed          : from the stage where I look for closest REPIN

For Step 5:
    Graph 5:
        (x axis) Plot graph  : for each cluster
        (y axis) showing     : How many REPINs are included because both flanking sequences match, and how many for LHS, RHS
        Example              : In a cluster of six REPINs, say A,B,C are grouped because both flanks match, then D because LHS
                               matches and E and F because RHSs match. Then the stacked bar graph would have 3, 1, 2 stacked
        Note                 : Also show as percentage or one graph for each type of stacking
        Data Needed          : post BLAST clustering stage

For Step 6:
    Graph 6:
        (x axis) Plot graph  : for each genome
        (y axis) showing     : How many REPINs from that genome are in-betweeners or transitive forming REPINs
        Example              : If a repin from genome X has its LHS matching with cluster 1 and RHS with cluster 2, then it will
                               not be merged with either cluster. Count how many such instances for every genome X.
        Note                 : Maybe do this per genome and per cluster also
        Data Needed          : post BLAST clustering stage
